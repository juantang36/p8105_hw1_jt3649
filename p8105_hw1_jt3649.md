``` r

```

### Dataset Description

The `early_january_weather` dataset has 358 rows (observations) and 15
columns (variables).

The variables in this dataset are: origin, year, month, day, hour, temp,
dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib,
time_hour.

The mean temperature across all observations is 39.5821229 ºF.

### Scatterplot of temp vs time_hour

Code for Scatterplot

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather,
       aes(x = time_hour, 
           y = temp, 
           color = humid
       )) + geom_point() + labs(title = "Temperature vs. Time Scatterplot", 
             x = "Time(Hour)", 
             y = "Temperature (ºF)", 
             color = "Humidity (%)")
```

Saving the plot

``` r
ggsave("temperature_vs_time_hour_Scatterplot.png", width = 8, height = 6)
```

### Description of Scatterplot

The scatterplot shows how temperature in New York changed during the
first two weeks of January 2013, with x-axis representing time, y-axis
representing temperature in ºF, and point color representing humidity.
The pattern shows a regular daily fluctuation in temperature, presenting
a consistent wave-like pattern.The temperature rises during daylight
hours and falls at night. Across the two-week period, there appears to
be a general upward trend in temperatures, with later days showing
higher temperatures overall compared to the beginning of the period.
Around January 14, there is a noticeable peak where the temperature
exceeded 56°F.

There is an inverse relationship between temperature and humidity in
general although the relationship is not strictly linear. Higher
temperatures are shown to correspond with lower humidity levels (darker
color) and lower temperatures correspond with higher humidity levels
(lighter colored points).

## Problem 2

Creating a dataframe

``` r
df=tibble(
  random_sample = rnorm(10), 
  logical_vec = random_sample > 0, 
  char_vec = letters[1:10], 
  factor_vec = factor(rep(c("low", "medium", "high"), 
                          length.out = 10),
                      levels = c("low", "medium", "high"))
)
```

This is the dataframe for problem 2:

``` r
df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    random_sample logical_vec char_vec factor_vec
    ##            <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1        0.550  TRUE        a        low       
    ##  2        0.126  TRUE        b        medium    
    ##  3       -0.440  FALSE       c        high      
    ##  4        0.433  TRUE        d        low       
    ##  5       -0.0657 FALSE       e        medium    
    ##  6       -0.813  FALSE       f        high      
    ##  7        0.500  TRUE        g        low       
    ##  8       -1.38   FALSE       h        medium    
    ##  9       -2.15   FALSE       i        high      
    ## 10       -1.82   FALSE       j        low

Take the mean of each variable in the dataframe df

``` r
#valid output for numeric variable
mean_random_sample = mean(pull(df, "random_sample")) 
cat("Mean of random sample variable =", mean_random_sample)
```

    ## Mean of random sample variable = -0.5056185

``` r
#valid output for logical variable
mean_logical_vec = mean(pull(df, "logical_vec"))
cat("Mean of logical vector =", mean_logical_vec)
```

    ## Mean of logical vector = 0.4

``` r
#invalid output for character variable
mean_char_vec = mean(pull(df, "char_vec"))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, "char_vec")): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
#invalid output for factor variable
mean_factor_vec = mean(pull(df, "factor_vec"))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, "factor_vec")): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

### Explanation

The mean of random_sample is -0.5056185. This mean works because it’s
numeric value. The mean of logical_vec is 0.4. This mean also works
because logical values are coerced to 0 (False) or 1 (TRUE). When a mean
is requested, the system automatically convert each TRUE to a 1 and each
FALSE to a 0. It then adds up all the 1s and 0s, and devides the sum by
the total number of values in the list. char_vec and factor_vec cannot
take mean values because they are text and categorical labels.

### as.numeric Function

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df, "random_sample")) 
as.numeric(pull(df, "logical_vec"))
as.numeric(pull(df, "factor_vec"))
```

### Explanation (as.numeric function)

The as.numeric function converts logical variables to numeric numbers.
“as.numeric(pull(df,”logical_vec”))” defines TRUE = 1 and FALSE = 0. The
mean therefore represents the proportion of TRUE values. Factor vectors
can be coerces to numeric, but they are converted to the internal
integer codes of the level (eg. low = 1, medium = 2, high = 3). In this
case, the mean can be computed. The function fails to convert characters
(string) to numeric, the output is “NA”. Mean cannot be taken for
characters because characters cannot be meaningfully converted into
numbers. Hence, mean() function works for numeric and logical variables,
and fails for character and factor. But if we use as.numeric to convert
factors to numeric numbers, mean can still be taken.
